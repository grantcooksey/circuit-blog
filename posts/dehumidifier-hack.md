I hate lights in my room while I sleep and we've got a couple appliances that love to give some feedback that they are on.

Although it's not that bright, it still annoys the shit out of me so at some point I got the bright idea that I could probably swap out the leds with similar diode. I popped the top off and with the help of some solder wick and 2 1N4148 diodes, the design flaw was corrected.

Here's the board with one of the swapped diodes and an original led.

And with all leds swapped out.

Pure bliss.
