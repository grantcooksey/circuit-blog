As a bonus, it also tells me my house is too humid so now I have to also figure that out. Fun.\n\nI was stubborn and wanted to use an attiny85 regardless of whether it was a good idea or not.\n5 pins isn't enough to control the display so I used a shift register as an IO expander to talk to the 1602 led display using SPI.\n\n![Prototype](/images/thermometer/prototype.jpg)\n\nThe temp/humidity sensor originally was an aht11 but apparently that unit is extremely sensitive to timing and I couldn't quite get it right with the attiny. I switched to an AM2301B and that used i2c for communication and worked really well.\n\nFirst try I soldered everything backwards but I eventually got it right.\n\n![Board](/images/thermometer/board.jpg)\n\n![Board2](/images/thermometer/board2.jpg)\n\n![Board3](/images/thermometer/board3.jpg)\n\n![Power Up](/images/thermometer/power-up.jpg)\n\nThe packing took forever and I ended up having to buy multiple project boxes to get the right size.\n\n![Packaging](/images/thermometer/packaging.jpg)\n\n![Assembly](/images/thermometer/assembly.jpg)\n\nAll done!\n\n![Final](/images/thermometer/final.jpg)\n"},{"slug":"bench-setup","frontmatter":{"title":"Bench Setup","date":"2022-07-16","tags":["bench"]},"content":"\n![Office](/images/office-early.jpg \"Office\")"},{"slug":"led-counter","frontmatter":{"title":"7 Segment LED Counter","date":"2022-07-15","tags":["led"]},"content":"\nThis was a funny project where I tried to build a simple 7 segment led counter without using a microcontroller. Each digit is controlled separately using 4026's and a sub 15 ms clock controlling which led is displayed, targeting a digit using a mux. 15 ms was chosen because it's faster than I could notice the counter changing, kinda like controlling led brightness using pwm. The counter ticks up based on a second slower clock or a button.\n\nI isolated the clocks into separate modules using 555 timers, both of which took forever to solder. One was in a fixed astable mode, the other a toggle-able monostable button debouncer or a bi-stable latch.\n\nRan out of diodes on this one...\n\n![LED Counter](/images/led-counter.jpg \"LED Counter\")\n"},{"slug":"first-oscillator","frontmatter":{"title":"Simple Oscillator","date":"2022-07-10","tags":["oscillator"]},"content":"\n![Oscillator](/images/first-oscillator.jpg \"An Oscillator\")\n\nProbably the first circuit I tried to solder together.
