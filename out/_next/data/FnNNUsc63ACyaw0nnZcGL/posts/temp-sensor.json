As a bonus, it also tells me my house is too humid so now I have to also figure that out. Fun.\n\nI was stubborn and wanted to use an attiny85 regardless of whether it was a good idea or not.\n5 pins isn't enough to control the display so I used a shift register as an IO expander to talk to the 1602 led display using SPI.\n\n![Prototype](/images/thermometer/prototype.jpg)\n\nThe temp/humidity sensor originally was an aht11 but apparently that unit is extremely sensitive to timing and I couldn't quite get it right with the attiny. I switched to an AM2301B and that used i2c for communication and worked really well.\n\nFirst try I soldered everything backwards but I eventually got it right.\n\n![Board](/images/thermometer/board.jpg)\n\n![Board2](/images/thermometer/board2.jpg)\n\n![Board3](/images/thermometer/board3.jpg)\n\n![Power Up](/images/thermometer/power-up.jpg)\n\nThe packing took forever and I ended up having to buy multiple project boxes to get the right size.\n\n![Packaging](/images/thermometer/packaging.jpg)\n\n![Assembly](/images/thermometer/assembly.jpg)\n\nAll done!\n\n![Final](/images/thermometer/final.jpg)\n","slug":"temp-sensor"},"__N_SSG":true}
