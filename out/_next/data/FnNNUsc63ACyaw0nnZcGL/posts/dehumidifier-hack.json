I popped the top off and with the help of some solder wick and 2 1N4148 diodes, the design flaw was corrected.\n\nHere's the board with one of the swapped diodes and an original led.\n![Mid swap](/images/hack-dehumidifier/progress.jpg \"A circuit board with an original led and a replaced diode\")\n\nAnd with all leds swapped out.\n![All swapped](/images/hack-dehumidifier/swapped.jpg \"A circuit board with leds swapped with diodes\")\n\nPure bliss.\n![Finished](/images/hack-dehumidifier/done.jpg \"Dehumidifier with no power lights.\")\n","slug":"dehumidifier-hack"},"__N_SSG":true}
