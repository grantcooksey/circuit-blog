Each digit is controlled separately using 4026's and a sub 15 ms clock controlling which led is displayed, targeting a digit using a mux. 15 ms was chosen because it's faster than I could notice the counter changing, kinda like controlling led brightness using pwm. The counter ticks up based on a second slower clock or a button.\n\nI isolated the clocks into separate modules using 555 timers, both of which took forever to solder. One was in a fixed astable mode, the other a toggle-able monostable button debouncer or a bi-stable latch.\n\nRan out of diodes on this one...\n\n![LED Counter](/images/led-counter.jpg \"LED Counter\")\n"},{"slug":"first-oscillator","frontmatter":{"title":"Simple Oscillator","date":"2022-07-10","tags":["oscillator"]},"content":"\nTODO\n"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
